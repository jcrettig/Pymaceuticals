Homework - Week 5 - Matplotlib - The Power of Plots


Homework Preparation Notes:

I kept getting a 403 message when I attempted to git push my homework to GitHub.  I discussed this with Fred and he made a couple of suggestions that unfortunately did not work.  As a result, I do not have any commits for this homework.  I was unable to fix this problem prior to the due date for the homework, so I uploaded my code to GitHub.  I will continue to work with Fred to get this situation resolved for the next assignment.  


Observations and Insights

I included the following in the jupyter code:

Of the 249 mice in the sample set, one mouse was determined to be a duplicate and was removed leaving 248 mice to be analyzed.

In reviewing the results of all drug regimens at all time points, Ramicane had the lowest overall average tumor mass along with the lowest median, variance, standard deviation and SEM.  Capomulin had the second lowest for all of these data points.  

Capomulin and Ramicane had the highest number of measurement points at 230 and 228, respectively

The population of mice tested was almost evenly divided between males and females at 50.4% and 49.6%, respectively

Focusing on the final measurement points for the top performing drugs – Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin, Capomulin’s lower quartile tumor volume was slightly higher (32.38 mm3) compared Ramicane (31.56 mm3) but was slightly lower at the upper quartile  - 40.16 mm3 vs. 40.66 mm3, respectively.  Capomulin’s results appear to be more consistent with an interquartile range of 7.78 mm3 compared to Ramicane at 7.10 mm3.  Infubinol and Ceftamin’s respective results were notably higher than Capomulin and Ramicane.  Infubinol had one outlier in its results.  

Selecting one mouse from the Capomulin data shows an initial increase in tumor mass followed by an overall reduction over time in the tumor volume.  It should be noted that this was not a statistical sample so this result alone cannot be relied upon as representative of the whole population.

When comparing the average tumor volume to the weight of each mouse, it appears that weight may be a factor in determining the volume of the tumors.  There is a very strong positive correlation between tumor volume and mouse weight.
